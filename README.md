# Responsive-Web-Design-Practice-Project
This project was built as a hands-on practice to understand how to make websites fully responsive from scratch using modern CSS techniques.  The goal of this project is to learn responsive layouts, media queries, and real-world UI structuring that adapts smoothly across devices like mobile, tablet, and desktop.
